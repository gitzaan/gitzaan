## My Projects

Here are some of the key projects I've worked on:

1. **[Energy Consumption Predictor with Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/gitzaan/Measure-Energy-Consumption-)**
   - Developed a machine learning model to forecast electricity production and detect anomalies using time series data, achieving an RÂ² score of 0.91.

2. **[Customizable URL Classifier](https://github.com/gitzaan/Customizable-URL-Classifier)**
   - Built a URL classification system utilizing a hybrid CNN/LSTM model to categorize URLs, achieving an accuracy of 87.4%.

3. **[NM_GAN Face Generation](https://github.com/gitzaan/NM_GAN_FaceGeneration)**
   - Implemented a GAN-based model to generate realistic celebrity face images using the CelebA dataset.

4. **[Dynamic Task Priority System](https://github.com/gitzaan/DynamicTaskPriority)**
   - Created a real-time task prioritization system using ESP32 and FreeRTOS, allowing manual reordering of task priorities based on real-time factors.

5. **[Gym Workout App (In Progress)]**
   - Currently developing a gym workout app that leverages an API for exercise recommendations, likely using RapidAPI.
